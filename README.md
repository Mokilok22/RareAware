# RareAware
Rare spawn addon for WoW Classic

-- Current Functionality --
This addon displays information on your map about rare spawns within the world and only works for WoW Classic. You will also be notified in chat when you are nearby a possible rare spawn.

-- ToDo --
Because of how WoW Classic works, there is currently no way for the addon to notify you when there is a nearby rarespawn up (similar to how NPCScan works). Will add this when something becomes available. Also no minimap icons yet.
